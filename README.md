**Teacher App API**
This project offers an API designed to handle teacher and course data from a school database. It enables the retrieval of teacher profiles, their associated courses, and supports filtering teachers based on a specified hire date range. The API returns data in JSON format, which is utilized on the front-end to present detailed information about teachers and their courses.
